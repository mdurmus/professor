## Design

### Colors

The color palette of the application primarily revolves around shades of blue and white. Various tones of blue are employed to create a cohesive visual experience. The use of a dark grey font ensures excellent legibility, offering a strong contrast against the light blue and white backgrounds. This thoughtful color combination enhances the overall readability and aesthetics of the interface.

### Fonts
Inter is a modern, clean, and readable sans-serif font family. It offers a broad range of characters and style variations, providing versatility in usage. Designed specifically for web applications and other digital platforms, Inter is commonly preferred in such projects. Offering good readability and aesthetics, Inter can assist in achieving a professional and contemporary appearance.

### Fixed Bug

**Timer not stopping**

The questions must stop with 0 in the countdown with the timer. However, if you do not use the clearInterval method, the timer object will not stop. As mentioned in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval, you need to clear the timer using the clearInterval method.

**Store User Information**
HTML and CSS cannot store data within pages due to their structure. However, I was able to store user information using Javascript's Sessionstorage feature. You can access the related document here. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage

**CSS and variable**
With CSS, instead of writing our color choices every time, we can set them once in the variables and then use this value over and over again wherever we want. You can access the related document from the link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties
